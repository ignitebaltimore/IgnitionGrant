#Ignite Baltimore's Ignition Grant
##Guidance for How To Get It Done

###Introduction
The [Ignition Grant](http://www.ignitebaltimore.com/grant) was created by [Ignite Baltimore](http://www.ignitebaltimore.com/) to fund new, innovative, feasible projects that aim to make Baltimore a better place to live and work. The intent is to inspire individuals to take action as well as spark and reward creative ideas that address the Cityâ€™s social and economic challenges. These grants are funded by proceeds from Ignite Baltimore ticket sales and occasionally by sponsors.
